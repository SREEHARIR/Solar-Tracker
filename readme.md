# SOLAR TRACKER

### A Dual Axis Solar Tracker

This dual axis solar tracker uses 4 LDR sensors to sense the light intensity in 4 directions. The panel is to be mounted on a dual axis setup of servo motors. A threshold between light intensity is used to smooth out the servo movements and to avoid jiggle of the mounted solar panel.
